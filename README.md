# Follow-Only Plugin

The **Follow-Only Plugin** for RuneLite restricts player movement, allowing the player to move only by using the **'follow'** feature on other players standing on adjacent tiles. This plugin is designed for those who want a unique and challenging way to navigate Gielinor, adding a social twist to movement and exploration in Old School RuneScape (OSRS).

## Features

- **Restricted Movement**: Disables the ability to move independently. The only way to traverse Gielinor is by following other players.
- **Adjacent Tile Requirement**: The follow action is only enabled if the player is on an adjacent tile to another player.
- **Improved Social Interaction**: Encourages cooperation and interaction with other players to progress in the game.

## Purpose and Inspiration

This plugin is intended for players looking to challenge themselves or create unique content, such as role-playing, YouTube series, or hardcore movement restrictions. The Follow-Only Plugin can add a layer of strategy, creativity, and humor to your OSRS gameplay!
