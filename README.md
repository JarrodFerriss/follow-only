Follow-Only Plugin for RuneLite
Plugin Name: Follow-Only
Author: Jarrod Ferriss

Overview
The Follow-Only plugin is a RuneLite plugin that enhances gameplay by restricting player movement. When enabled, this plugin prevents the character from moving independently, only allowing movement by following another player on an adjacent tile. This unique restriction adds a social and humorous dynamic to gameplay, creating a challenge that depends on the cooperation and positioning of other players for navigation.

Features
Movement Restriction: Players are unable to move freely, adding a unique layer of challenge and strategy.
Follow-Only Mechanics: Movement is only possible by following another player on an adjacent tile.
Increased Social Interaction: Adds a social element to the game, encouraging player interaction as the only way to navigate the game world.
